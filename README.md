This is a simple application I built using the datamuse thesaurus API. The project is coded in React.js using Typescript and custom hooks for rendering a list of possible synonyms. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
